# Rust and Postgres

Just learning rust and postgres. Trying out tokio and async to start. Will try
some of the other libraries as well

Todo:
- [x] [postgres mapper](https://github.com/toidiu/postgres-mapper)
  - doesn't work with datetime
- [x] [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/)
- [x] [bulk insert](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/populate.html)
  - async & sync
  - csv & prepared statements

## Notes

Added docker compose for booting up pg database

`docker compose up -d`
