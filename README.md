# Rust and Postgres

Just learning rust and postgres. Trying out tokio and async to start. Will try
some of the other libraries as well

Todo:
- [x] [postgres mapper](https://github.com/toidiu/postgres-mapper)
  - doesn't work with datetime
- [ ] [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/)
- [ ] async std
- [ ] actix
- [ ] bulk insert
  - async & sync
  - csv & prepared statements

## Notes

Added docker compose for booting up pg database

`docker compose up -d`
